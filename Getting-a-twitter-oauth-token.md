In order to use the Twitter Agent, you'll need some special Twitter credentials for OAuth.

If you don't have a Twitter Application yet, please visit the following URL:

https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

You'll need to name your application.  Perhaps something like: `John's Huginn`

You'll also need a description, which could be: `John's personal Huginn system (http://github.com/cantino/huginn)`.

The required website could be your personal site, or your Twitter profile URL.  You don't need a callback URL.

On the next page, click 'Create my Access Token'.  You may need to refresh the page before the token shows up.

Copy your 'Access token', 'Access token secret', 'Consumer key', and 'Consumer secret', and put them into a Twitter Agent as needed.
