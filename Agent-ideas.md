* Boxcar support for sending push notification messages to iOS devices
* Gmail OAuth2 login support
* Generic IMAP/POP support for incoming and outgoing email
* Dropbox OAuth support
* Feedly support (get marked for later)
* PagerDuty - trigger [PagerDuty](http://developer.pagerduty.com/documentation/integration/events)incidents based on events, *or* take different actions based on incoming PagerDuty incidents.
* Pocket support ( put something into read queue)
* RescueTime support (detect/report productivity or lack thereof)
* Readability support ( put something into read later)
* Google Search results (changes in SERP for specified keyword and/or specified url)
* Whois tracking (detect changes in whois details for a domain)
* Website status monitoring (alert when website is down)
* an mqtt subscriber/publisher, see mqtt.org
* github agent see https://github.com/peter-murach/github
* Dedicated RSS Reader agent that can accumulate unique data (The Website agent can already [handle RSS](https://github.com/cantino/huginn/wiki/Agent-configuration-examples#itunes-trailers))
* RSS Publisher agent. Presumably Huginn itself would host the RSS. This would provide one avenue for passing information between Huginn instances.
