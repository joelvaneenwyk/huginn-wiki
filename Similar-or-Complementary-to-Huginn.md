# Similar or complementary to Huginn

Decided there should be a place to track interesting things related or complementary to Huginn (other than the random 'never quite sure if they should be closed' issues I keep opening)

Feel free to add new things, but let's try and keep them in some kind of alphabetized order.

* [Evented API](http://www.eventedapi.org) - We envision a world where applications integrate multiple products and services as equals based on event-driven interactions. Event APIs following the form described in this document enable building such applications.
* [The Live Web](http://smile.amazon.com/The-Live-Web-Event-Based-Connections/dp/1133686680?sa-no-redirect=1) - Imagine a world in which your phone automatically mutes the ringer when you start watching a movie.

Imagine a world in which the mundane parts of business travel or scheduling an appointment with a new doctor are automatically taken care of according to your preferences. That world is the Live Web.
