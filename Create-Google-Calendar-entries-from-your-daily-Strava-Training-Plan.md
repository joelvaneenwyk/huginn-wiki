### New Year Resolutions: Participate at a marathon and automate my life.

Ok, this sound silly and maybe it is, but I want to use my (poor) coding skills to automate things as far as possible and I want to participate at a marathon this year. Oh and by the way, I am not the youngest person on earth anymore :-)

To prepare for the marathon I started a training plan on [Strava](https://www.strava.com), a platform for fitness enthusiasts. Strava send me a daily instruction for my training via email. But I want the instructions as a google calendar entry, where I organize my life. So I started dealing with Huginn, to gain experience in automating things.

I created in Huginn a workflow like this:
